# math-practice

Just a simple game / drill tool to help my kids practice their time tables

Currently, it spits out single-digit multiplication problems,
advances to the next one when you get it right,
and counts your total wins.

## Run

Just host the files on a basic HTTP server. If you need something simple locally...

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
